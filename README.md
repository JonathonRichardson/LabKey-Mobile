# LabKey-Mobile
Module for LabKey for a mobile-friendly interface.

#Installation
Note that the following instructions assume that you have downloaded the [LabKey source](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=sourceCode) from their repository, and that there's an environment variable named `LABKEY_ROOT` that points to the directory that holds the `server` and `build` directories.

Move into the `server/optionalModules/` directory and clone this repository there.
